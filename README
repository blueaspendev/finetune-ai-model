1. pip install -r requirements.txt
this will install all the required dependencied to run the program


2. replace the input dataset  which contains a mix of structured and unstructured data with dataset.json (i have taken a sample data)

3. create a database in mysql named mydatabase
4. in data_ingestion.py file replace username and password in line 14
5. python data_ingestion.py - to run the file
this will create a my_table in databse

5. in data_preprocessing.py file replace username and password in line 7
6. python data_preprocessing.py - to run this file
this will create a preprocessed_table in database

7. in data_vectorisation file enter your pinecone apikey in line 9 and sql details in line 38
8. python data_vectorisation.py - to run the file
this will generate embeddings for the unstructured text data and store them in the vector database

9. update api keys and details in line 14 to 17
10. python api.py - to run the server
